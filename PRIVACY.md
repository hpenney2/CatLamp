# CatLamp Privacy Policy

## Why we collect data
CatLamp collects certain information visible to the bot for bot functionality and administration.

## Deletion Policy
For CatLamp, a user or server administrator may request that their data be deleted. However, we do not prevent the bot from recollecting the data from a future source.

If you are considered an Involved User, you may request that your attribution is removed in the code or from the official configuration.

## What we always collect

### User IDs
We collect user IDs for reference in reminders (`+remind`).

### Server IDs
We collect server identification, member count, and owner names for our auditing logs.

### User-Submitted Content
- We save the note attached to any reminders (`+remind`) for reference.
- We also anonymously save search queries provided in the reddit command (`+reddit`).

### Involved Users' IDs
If you are involved in the development of CatLamp or are listed as an Administrator, your identification number is saved for reference in bot functions (attribution and permission checks are the common uses).

## What we log in terminal

### Locked Command Usage
If a command locked to CatLamp Administrators is used, the terminal may log the username and identifier of the invoker.

## Note
We reserve the right to revise this privacy policy without notice, as needed.
