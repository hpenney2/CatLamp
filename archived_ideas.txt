Command Category Idea:
Package +reddit into cogs.misc.reddit
customFooter = str
if footer, force embedded image
Also make commands 
(
obligatory
		  +aww
		  +dog
		  +meme
		  +nsfw things of course
)

Instead of +miscReload, use cog getting to screw with a boolean that'll tellreddit to reload itself with it's time.
